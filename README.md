# Animal-Quizzes
Website for you to enjoy reading the fun facts of animals and trying the animal quizzes.

Welcome to the website about our pets.

ABOUT US:

We’re a team of four coders. One of the team is of Chinese heritage and the rest of us are British. It follows that most of the site is in English, but you might notice some Chinese influence too!

Three of us have written about our actual pets. The fourth is “between pets” and has explored the idea of an exotic pet.

Do enjoy reading about them and trying the pet quizzes.
